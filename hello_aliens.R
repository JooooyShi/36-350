cat("Hey! I wish I could still be alive when you are able to read this letter. Just a little bit about myself: I'm a female earthling studying statistics in college. I don't know how education looks like in your world but for me, it was a lot of homework, exams and R projects. If you don't know R, it's a statistical software that is useful but hard to master. Do you also program? What softwares do you use? Or do you not even use computers? There are so many different rumors about you that I look forward to seeing the scientists admit they are wrong about you guys. Please stop by earth when you have time! Just don't destroy it even if it's easy for you!" )
